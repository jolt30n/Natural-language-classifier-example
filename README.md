# Natural-language-classifier-example
This will be using a classifier to classify weather questions, whether it is a question involving temperature or the condition of the weather.

Currently this respository is holding the basic necessary files to start the program on a localhost. You may pull or get the other files from the Natural Language Classifier page provided by IBM on Github.

We will also be using Bluemix, a cloud platform developed by IBM. Here, it is mainly used to push our program onto the server.

The server.js file is where the server will execute and run your program on a local server on your browser.
The app.js is where the classifier creates bluemix instances and instances for your program. 
The weather_data_train.csv file is where we store the questions and whether it is a temperature or a condition question.
